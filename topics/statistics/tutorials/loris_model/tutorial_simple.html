<p>In this tutorial, we will use a comprehensive dataset of patients treated with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) and non-ICB-treated patients across 18 solid tumor types to develop LORIS (Logistic Regression-based Immunotherapy-Response Score). The goal is to accurately predict patient responses to the treatment.</p>

<p>To achieve this, we will follow three essential steps: (i) upload the patient data training file to Galaxy, (ii) set up and run the Tabular Learner Tool to train the best model, and (iii) evaluate the model’s predictive performance by comparing it to the published LORIS model ({% cite Chang2024 %}).</p>

<h1>Dataset composition (features) to train the model </h1>

<p>Before we begin the hands-on session, here’s a brief explanation of the features we’ll be using. These features were selected based on the findings of Chang et al. (2024), who identified them as the most important for training the model.</p>

<p>It's important to note that other features were tested in different combinations and model architectures. However, the authors concluded that the six features selected are the most valuable for achieving the best model performance.</p>

<h2>TMB (Tumor mutation burden)</h2>
Tumor mutation burden (TMB) is defined as the total number of somatic mutations within a specified region of the tumor genome. It has been recognized as a biomarker for predicting the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) in solid tumors. The <a href="https://www.fda.gov/">U.S. Food and Drug Administration</a> (FDA) has approved a threshold of 10 mutations per megabase (mut/Mb) as a biomarker for response to ICB treatment.

<p>In this dataset, TMB values range from 0 to over 368 mutations per megabase, with some extreme values, such as 368.6 and 93.5. To mitigate the influence of these outliers, TMB values will be truncated at 50 mut/Mb, meaning any value exceeding 50 will be capped at 50. This is crucial because extreme TMB values can disproportionately skew the model’s learning process, leading to unreliable predictions.</p>

<h2>Systemic Therapy History</h2>
This feature is a binary variable that indicates whether a patient received chemotherapy or targeted therapy prior to immunotherapy. It is coded as 1 if the patient had undergone such treatments before starting immunotherapy, and 0 if they had not.

<h2>Albumin</h2>
The albumin feature represents the albumin levels measured in patients, which is an important biomarker often associated with nutritional status and liver function. The values are measured in grams per deciliter (g/dL) and typically range between 2.1 and 4.9 g/dL in the dataset. Higher levels of albumin are generally associated with better overall health and can serve as an indicator of a patient's ability to recover or respond to treatments like immunotherapy.

<h2>Cancer Type</h2>
The CancerType feature represents the type of cancer diagnosed in each patient, which can vary significantly across the dataset. Common types include Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC), Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC), Melanoma, Endometrial cancer, and other cancer types such as Gastric, Colorectal, Renal, and Breast cancer. This feature is critical for understanding the heterogeneity of the patient cohort and may influence treatment decisions, response rates, and outcomes.

<p>Incorporating this feature into a machine learning model requires translating the categorical CancerType into one-hot encoded variables. Each cancer type will be represented as a binary feature (0 or 1), with each type becoming a separate column in the dataset. This enables the model to interpret the presence or absence of a specific cancer type for each patient.</p>

<h2>NLR (blood neutrophil–lymphocyte ratio)</h2>
The neutrophil–lymphocyte ratio (NLR), a biomarker derived from the ratio of neutrophils to lymphocytes in the blood, is increasingly used in cancer research due to its association with inflammation and immune response. It can serve as a prognostic factor in various cancer types. Higher NLR values often indicate a poorer prognosis, potentially reflecting a more aggressive disease or impaired immune response.

<p>In this dataset, NLR values range, for example, from 0.8 to 88, with several extreme outliers. To address this, NLR values will be truncated at 25, meaning any value above 25 will be capped at 25. This truncation is important for preventing extreme outliers from disproportionately influencing the machine learning model.</p>

<h2>Age</h2>
In predictive models for patient outcomes, age is a crucial feature because it is often correlated with various health factors and disease risks. As people age, their immune systems, metabolism, and ability to recover from illnesses may change, influencing how they respond to treatments, medications, or disease progression. Including age as a feature helps models account for the biological changes that occur over time and can improve the accuracy of predictions across different age groups.

<p>However, there are limits to how predictive age might be, particularly for extreme values. For example, patients over a certain age may share similar health characteristics, and further increases in age may not significantly add predictive value. Truncating age to a maximum value (like 85) helps avoid overemphasizing small differences between very old patients, where the added predictive power might be negligible.</p>

<h2>Response</h2>
The Response feature is a categorical target variable indicating whether patients benefited from immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy, classified as 0 (no benefit) or 1 (benefit). The model is trained using all previous features to predict patient outcomes when ICB is chosen as the treatment.

<h1>Model Architecture Selection Process</h1>

<p>In the article ({% cite Chang2024 %}), the model was trained using different architectures, including Decision Tree, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and XGBoost, using the scikit-learn framework (full code is available here: <a href="https://github.com/rootchang/LORIS/tree/main/code">Chang et al., github repo</a>. In the end, the best model architecture was a Logistic LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) Regression model, fitting the six features discussed above. This model was named LLR6.</p>

<p>It is important to note that Tabular Learner has the capability of training different model architectures, just as was done by Chang et al., 2024, but automatically. At the end of the run, a tabular list ranked by decreasing model performance is output.</p>

<p>When setting up the Tabular Learner tool, one option, <code>Only Select Classification Models if you don't want to compare all models,</code> can be used to select specific architectures to be tested during training. Since the purpose of this tutorial is to replicate what was done, this option won't be used, and therefore, all possible models will be trained. Thus, we expect to obtain the same results as Chang et al., where the Logistic Regression Model has the best performance among all other models.</p>

<h1>Tool output files</h1>
After training and testing your model, you should see two new files in your history list:

<ul><li>Tabular Learner Best Model: The Tabular Learner model pickle file. This file allows the model to be reused without requiring retraining, ensuring consistent predictions.</li>

<li>Tabular Learner Model Report: This file contains all the plots for the models trained, along with the best model selected.</li>

<p>For this tutorial, we will focus on the Tabular Learner Model Report.</p>

<h1>Tabular Learner Model Report </h1>
The Tabular Learner HTML report provides a comprehensive and interactive overview of the trained model’s performance in an accessible, browser-ready format. This report documents key aspects of the model’s training and evaluation process, offering insights into how well the model performed on both the training and test datasets. The report consists of four tabs: Setup & Best Model, Best Model Plots, Feature Importance, and Explainer.
!<a href="../../images/loris_tutorial/report_tabs.png "Tabs in the Tabular Learner Report"">report tabs</a>

<p>Below is a brief explanation of the content in each tab of the report.</p>

<p>> <tip-title>Setup & Best Model Tab</tip-title>

<h1>LORIS PanCancer LLR6 Model Robustness:</h1>

<p>Understanding the objective of this analysis is essential. Since we aim to build a model comparable to the one published by {% cite Chang2024 %}, and we indeed obtained the same Logistic Regression model architecture, this allows us to use the metrics from that paper as a benchmark to assess the performance of the model we develop through Galaxy-Tabular Learner.</p>

<p>> <tip-title>Robustness definition </tip-title>
>
> Some evidence is considered robust if it holds up across reasonable variations in analysis, while fragile evidence depends heavily on specific analytical choices, such as the inclusion or exclusion of certain observations or covariates.
>
> Robustness, therefore, refers to assessing the reliability of previous findings by applying different analytical approaches to the same dataset.>

<h2>Classification Algorithms</h2>
A key feature of Tabular Learner is its capability to train and compare multiple models with minimal code. By default, Tabular Learner evaluates a diverse range of algorithms, including linear models, tree-based models, and ensemble methods, ranking these models based on their performance. The primary metric used to determine the best-performing model is the accuracy. 
!<a href="../../images/loris_tutorial/model_comparison.png "Comparison of Model Performance Metrics Across Algorithms"">Comparison results on the cross-validation set</a>

<p>In this case, the best-performing algorithm for this dataset matches the findings reported in the article: the Logistic Regression model.</p>

<h2>Hyperparameters</h2>
The model from {% cite Chang2024 %} for the Pan-Cancer LLR6 model has the following hyperparameters set: C = 0.1, Class Weight = Balanced, L1 ratio = 1, max iter = 100, Penalty = Elasticnet, Solver = Saga.

<p>The hyperparameter search performed by Galaxy-Tabular Learner resulted in slightly different settings for the model: C = 1.0, Class Weight = None, L1 ratio = None, max iter = 1000, Penalty = L2, Solver = LBFGS.</p>

<p>!<a href="../../images/loris_tutorial/hyperparameters.png "Table showing the hyperparameters set for the selected model"">Model hyperparameters table</a></p>

<p>The differences found in the hyperparameters guide the analysis towards testing the robustness of the LORIS Score proposed by {% cite Chang2024 %}.</p>

<p>> <comment-title>Hyperparameters meaning</comment-title>
>
> <em>Penalty</em> - Defines the type of regularization applied to the model to prevent overfitting. Options for linear and logistic regression are: </code>L1<code>, </code>L2<code>, and </code>Elasticnet<code>. Briefly, L1 (Lasso Regression) removes less important features, helping to overcome overfitting as well as performing dimension reduction. However, when most features (variables) in the model are useful, L2 (Ridge Regression) is used. Elasticnet regularization combines both L1 and L2, addressing multicollinearity while also enabling feature selection. When Elasticnet is selected, it opens the L1 Ratio parameter.
>
> <em>L1-Ratio</em> - Controls the balance between L1 and L2 penalties. A value of </code>1<code> uses purely L1 regularization, which encourages sparsity. A value of </code>0<code> uses purely L2.
>
> <em>C</em> - Is the inverse of the regularization strength. A smaller C (like </code>0.1<code>) implies stronger regularization, which prevents overfitting by penalizing large coefficients and also makes the model simpler (smaller coefficients). In contrast, higher values make the model more complex.
>
> <em>Solver</em> - Specifies the optimization algorithm used for fitting the model. </code>SAGA<code> is well-suited for large datasets and supports the Elasticnet penalty. It is also effective for sparse data and is fast for L1. </code>LBFGS<code> is a quasi-Newton optimization algorithm, efficient for smaller datasets, supports L2 regularization, but does not support Elasticnet.
>
> <em>Class Weight</em> - Is used to handle imbalanced classes by adjusting the weight associated with each class. Balanced adjusts these weights inversely proportional to class frequencies in the data, giving more weight to the minority class.
>
> <em>Max Iter</em> - Specifies the </code>maximum number` of iterations the solver will run before stopping. If convergence is achieved earlier, it will stop; if not, you may need to increase the value.

<h2>Model Evaluation Metrics</h2>
In this study, we compare the performance of machine learning models built using two different frameworks: PyCaret and Scikit-learn ({% cite Chang2024 %}). The comparison focuses on four model evaluation metrics—Accuracy, Area Under the Curve (AUC), F1 Score, and Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC)—to assess the relative strengths and performance of each model and draw conclusions about the robustness of the LORIS Score.

<p>!<a href="../../images/loris_tutorial/test_metrics_results.png "Performance Metrics of the Model After Testing"">Model metrics table</a></p>

<li>Accuracy</li>
Accuracy measures the proportion of correct predictions among all predictions. The PyCaret model outperformed the Scikit-learn model in terms of accuracy, achieving 0.80 compared to 0.6803 for the Scikit-learn model. This suggests that the PyCaret model was able to correctly classify a higher percentage of samples, indicating better overall predictive performance on the given dataset. Furthermore, the higher accuracy across multiple runs demonstrates a level of consistency in the performance of the LORIS Score, regardless of the specific model-building tool used.

<li>Area Under the Curve (AUC)</li>
AUC provides an aggregate measure of performance across all classification thresholds, with higher values indicating better model performance. The PyCaret model exhibited a moderate AUC of 0.7599, slightly outperforming the Scikit-learn model’s AUC of 0.7155. This suggests that the PyCaret model had better discrimination between positive and negative classes, demonstrating a more robust ability to distinguish between the two across various thresholds. Despite using different frameworks, both models achieved relatively high AUC values, which reinforces the LORIS Score's consistent discriminatory power and overall robustness.

<li>F1 Score</li>
The F1 Score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, offering a balanced measure of a model’s ability to correctly classify both positive and negative classes, particularly in the context of imbalanced datasets. The Scikit-learn model achieved a higher F1 score of 0.5289, compared to the PyCaret model’s F1 score of 0.4246. This suggests that, while the PyCaret model outperformed in terms of accuracy and AUC, the Scikit-learn model might have demonstrated a better balance between precision and recall, making it more effective at identifying positive instances.

<li>Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC)</li>
The MCC is a more balanced metric for binary classification, as it considers all four categories from the confusion matrix (True Positive, True Negative, False Positive, False Negative). The Scikit-learn model achieved a higher MCC of 0.4652, compared to the PyCaret model’s MCC of 0.3764. This suggests that, while both models showed moderate performance, the Scikit-learn model demonstrated a better balance between false positives and false negatives, making it more reliable in terms of overall classification accuracy, especially in the case of imbalanced datasets.

<p>The comparison between the PyCaret and Scikit-learn models demonstrates consistent performance across multiple evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, AUC, F1 score, and MCC. The slight differences in the results reflect the inherent flexibility of the LORIS Score, showing that a model built using two different frameworks—PyCaret and Scikit-learn—can still yield comparable performance.</p>

<p>The results suggest that small variations in the analytical approach do not significantly impact the model's ability to distinguish between classes, thereby providing confidence in the robustness of the LORIS Score for future applications.</p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
In this tutorial, we demonstrated how to use the Galaxy-Tabular Learner Tool to build a machine learning model for ICB treatment patient selection using clinical data. We followed a structured approach consisting of:
<li>Uploading datasets (.tsv)</li>
<li>Running the Tabular Learner</li>
<li>Evaluating the model's performance using the metrics published by {% cite Chang2024 %} as the gold standard.</li></ul>

<p>Throughout the process, we showcased how Tabular Learner simplifies the complexities of machine learning workflows, making them more accessible and efficient for users. Additionally, we explored the robustness of the LORIS Score by building a Logistic Regression model with different hyperparameters.</p>

<p>By the end of this tutorial, you should have a solid understanding of how to deploy a traditional machine learning model using tabular data and effectively interpret its results.</p>
